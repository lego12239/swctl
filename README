swctl
==========

swctl is the command line utility written in Perl for controlling snmp devices.
The main purpose is to provide a common interface to various network devices.


Install
==========

For example we use /opt/swctl directory for swctl.
After we copy swctl files to it, we must change the first line of swctl.pl to
the next:

#!/usr/bin/perl -W -I/opt/swctl


Usage
==========

Try ./swctl.pl help to see options and commands.

swctl.pl support commands shortening like a iproute2. E.g., instead of:

./swctl.pl ip bind show 10.0.0.1

we can write:

./swctl.pl ip b sh 10.0.0.1

to see ip-port bindings on 10.0.0.1 switch.


Supported devices and actions
=============================

dlink des-3200-28:
- ip-port binding (ACL);

dlink des-3526:
- ip-port binding (ACL);

dlink dgs-1100-06/ME:
- ip-port binding (ACL);


Device Specifics
================

dlink:
======

dlink ip-port binding based on ACL. By default, swctl use profile id 3 to
work with ip-port bindings. To change this settings you must consult
dlink.pm(for light help) and needed pm for a specific switch model(e.g.
DES_3526.pm).
